❗Attention: The released application has not been updated for a long time. You are highly recommended to run the python program by your self to experience newest feature and optimization.

## Usage
1. Download the newly released executable application.
2. Run the application.

 macOS user attention: the `timetable.ics` will be saved in the user directory like `/Users/your_user_name/timetable.ics`, not the folder of the application.
